SICOR (Sentinel-2 Image Correction for Atmospheric Effects) is specifically designed to perform atmospheric correction on Sentinel-2 Level-1C images, which contain Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data. These Level-1C products still include atmospheric disturbances such as aerosols, water vapor, and Rayleigh scattering. SICOR estimates and removes these effects to produce surface reflectance, yielding data that more accurately represents ground conditions. 

Sicor algorithm cannot be applied directly on tif images it needs meta data to be applied while downloading sentinel 2 level 1C images these images comes with .xml files these XML metadata files contains important data such as solar zenith angle, sensor zenith angle, and other necessary values for applying SICOR. These meta data files need to be first extracted the SICOR algorithm will use this metadata to correct the TOA reflectance to surface reflectance.
